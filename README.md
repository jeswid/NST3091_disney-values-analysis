## Background

Disney movies have influenced societal perspectives on gender roles, racial inclusivity, and morality. This study examines how these portrayals have evolved through **the Classics, Renaissance, and New Age eras** of Disney films.

### Objectives:

1. Identify trends in the portrayal of **female empowerment, racial inclusivity, and moral values**.
2. Conduct **qualitative** analysis using movie scripts and **quantitative** analysis using box office data.
3. Address research gaps with **longitudinal analysis** of Disneyâ€™s narrative changes over time.

## Methodology

### Qualitative Analysis

- **Thematic Coding**: Classification of Disney films based on the presence and portrayal of specific social values using a modified tick-and-cross matrix method.

### Quantitative Analysis

- **Regression Modeling**: Log-linear Poisson regression was employed to understand correlations between movie portrayals and regional box office earnings.
- **BERT Model**: Pre-trained BERT models were used to derive confidence scores for the portrayal of key values in film scripts.
- **Topic Modeling**: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was utilized to identify hidden topics within film scripts.
