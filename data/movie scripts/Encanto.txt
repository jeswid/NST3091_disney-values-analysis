(ABUELA SPEAKING SPANISH)
(ENCHANTING MUSIC PLAYING)
This is where our magic comes from?
Mm-hmm.
This candle holds the miracle
given to our family.
How did we get a miracle?
Long ago,
when my three babies had just been born,
your Abuelo Pedro and I
were forced to flee our home.
And though many joined us,
hoping to find a new home,
we could not escape the dangers
and your abuelo was lost.
But in our darkest moment,
we were given a miracle.
The candle became a magical flame
that could never go out.
And it blessed us
with a refuge in which to live.
A place of wonder.
YOUNG MIRABEL: An encanto.
ABUELA: An encanto.
The miracle grew.
And our house,
our casita itself
came alive to shelter us.
When my children came of age,
the miracle blessed each
with a magic Gift to help us.
And when their children came of age...
YOUNG MIRABEL: They got magic, too.
ABUELA: (CHUCKLING) That's right!
And together, our family's Gifts
have made our new home a paradise.
Tonight, this candle
will give you your Gift, mi vida.
Strengthen our community,
strengthen our home.
Make your family proud.
Make my family proud.
(FIREWORKS EXPLODING)
Yes, yes, casita, we're going!
(YOUNG MIRABEL GIGGLING)
What do you think my Gift will be?
You are a wonder, Mirabel Madrigal.
Whatever Gift awaits
will be just as special as you.
(UPLIFTING MUSIC PLAYS)
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)
(EXHALES) Make your family proud.

(CHILDREN CONTINUE REPEATING)
My cousin Dolores can hear
This whole chorus a mile away
Look
It's Mr. Mariano
Hey you can marry my sister
If you wanna
Between you and me
She's kind of a prima donna
Oh, I've said too much
And thank you
But I really gotta go
-My family's amazing
-Mirabel
-And I'm in my family so
-Mirabel
Well
- (MUSIC ENDS ABRUPTLY)
- ABUELA: (SHOUTS) Mirabel!
What are you doing?
Uh, they were just asking
about the family and...
She was about to tell us
about her super awesome Gift!
Oh, Mirabel didn't get one.
(SQUEAKS)
You didn't get a Gift?
- Um...
- Mirabel! Delivery!
I gave you the special
since you're the only
Madrigal kid with no Gift.
I call it the "Not Special Special"
since, uh, you have no Gift.
Thanks.
Oh, and tell Antonio good luck.
The last Gift ceremony was a bummer.
Last one being yours
- that did not work.
- Uh-huh.
If I was you, I'd be really sad.
Well, my little friend, I am not.
Because the truth is, Gift or no Gift,
I am just as special
as the rest of my family.
ISABELA: Who wants more pink?
LUISA: All right, guys,
where do I drop the wagon?
Maybe your Gift is being in denial.
PEPA: I made a rainbow!
WOMAN: Get the chairs out of the way.
(MIRABEL GRUNTING)
Sorry. Excuse me.
PEPA: Dolores, can you hear
if anyone is gonna be late?
Huh? Whoop!
ABUELA: Lift it higher. Higher.
CAMILO: Hey, nice job over there.
- JOS: Yeah, yeah.
- Camilo, we need another Jos!
Jos!
ABUELA: Luisa, the piano goes upstairs!
I'm on it! Careful, sis!
(GRUNTING)
PEPA: My baby's night has to be perfect,
and it's not perfect.
And people are going to be coming.
- And nothing's ready.
- You're tornado-ing the flowers!
The flowers!
Did someone say flowers?
- MAN: Isabela!
- (WOMAN LAUGHS)
FLIX: Our angel, our angel!
Please don't clap.
- Thank you.
- Oh, it's nothing.
(GRUNTS)
A little sisterly advice,
if you weren't always trying too hard,
you wouldn't be in the way.
Actually, Isa, this is called helping.
And I'm not in the way. You are.
(GRUNTS)
- (GRUNTING)
- Whoa.
Excuse me.
Mi vida, you okay?
You don't have to overdo it.
I know, Mam.
I just wanna do my part
like the rest of the family.
- She's right, amor.
- Eesh.
First Gift ceremony since yours.
A lot of emotions.
- Bee stings!
- AGUSTN: And I've been there.
Ay, Agustn.
When me and your to Flix
married into the family,
outsiders who had no Gift,
never, ever would...
surrounded by the exceptional,
it was easy to feel
un-ceptional.
Okay, Papi.
- I'm just saying, I get it.
- Eat.
Mi amor, if you ever wanna talk...
I gotta put out the stuff.
The house isn't gonna decorate itself.
Sorry, you could. You look great.
- Corazon, remember!
- Yeah, remember!
- You have nothing to prove!
- You have nothing to prove!
MIRABEL: Mm-hmm.
(JULIETA SIGHS)
FLIX: Ah, los musicos.
You guys can set up over here.
ABUELA: Clean your rooms!
I don't care how big they are.
TIPLE MAESTRO: Has anybody seen my tiple?
- ABUELA: One hour!
- (GASPS)
Oh!
(GRUNTS) No, no, no!
Maybe you should leave the decorations
to someone else?
No, I actually made these
as a surprise for you. Ooh!
Ooh! (CHUCKLES)
Mirabel, I know you want to help.
But tonight must go perfectly.
The whole town relies
on our family, on our Gifts.
So, the best way for some of us to help
is to step aside.
Let the rest of the family
do what they do best.
Okay?
Mm-hmm.
(WIND BLOWING)
- Pepa! You have a cloud!
- I know, Mam.
But now I can't find Antonio.
What do you want from me?
(THUNDER RUMBLES)
Mam, be nice to Mirabel, okay?
You know tonight will be hard for her.
ABUELA: If the Gift ceremony
doesn't go well this time,
tonight will be hard for us all.
(MIRABEL SIGHS)
FLIX: Antonio!
(SIGHS DEEPLY)
Everyone's looking for you.
This present will self-destruct
if you don't take it
in three,
two,
one... Oh. (CHUCKLES)
Nervous?
You have nothing to worry about.
You're gonna get your Gift
and open that door
and it's gonna be the coolest ever.
I know it.
(WHISPERS) What if it doesn't work?
Well, in that impossible scenario,
you'd stay here in the nursery with me.
(WHISPERS DRAMATICALLY) Forever.
And I'd get you all to myself.
I wish you could have a door.
You know what?
You don't have to worry about me,
'cause I have an amazing family
and an amazing house.
And an amazing you.
And seeing you get
your special Gift and your door,
that's gonna make me
way more happy than anything.
(SIGHS) But, alas,
I am gonna miss having
the world's best roomie.
(GASPS)
(CHUCKLES) I know you're an animal guy
and I made this so,
when you move into your cool, new room,
you always have something to snuggle with.
All right, hombrecito, you ready?
(COLOMBIA, MI ENCANTO PLAYING)
Sorry, I got to get one more squeeze.
(GIGGLING)
Okay, okay, we're going!
MIRABEL: Ow! Ow!

- Whee!
Colombia, I love you so much
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh...
(LAUGHS) There you are.
Look at you! All grown up.
Pepi, amor, you're gonna get him all wet.
(IMITATES FLIX) You are
making your papa proud.
I don't sound like that.
(IMITATES FLIX) I don't sound like that.
Abuela says it's time.
We'll be waiting at your door.
Okay, okay. Vamo, vamo, vamo.
(IMITATES FLIX) Okay, okay.
Vamo, vamo, vamo.
(IN NORMAL VOICE) All right, I'm done!

Fifty years ago,
in our darkest moment,

(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)
Don't be upset or mad at all
Don't feel regret Or sad a t all
Hey, I'm still a part
Of the family Madrigal
And I'm fine I am totally fine
I will stand on the side
As you shine
I'm not fine I'm not fine
I can't move the mountains
I can't make flowers bloom
I can't take another night
Up in my room
Waiting on a miracle
I can't heal what's broken
Can't control the morning rain
Or a hurricane
Can't keep down
The unspoken invisible pain
Always waiting on a miracle
A miracle
Always walking alone
Always wanting for more
Like I'm still at that door
Longing to shine
Like all of you shine
All I need is a change
All I need is a chance
All I know
Is I can't stay on the side
Open your eyes
Open your eyes Open your eyes
I would move the mountains
Make new trees and flowers grow
Someone please
Just let me know where do I go
I am waiting on a miracle
A miracle
I would heal what's broken
Show this family something new
Who I am inside
So what can I do?
I'm sick of waiting On a miracle
So here I go
I am ready Come on, I'm ready
I've been patient
And steadfast and steady
Bless me now
As you blessed us
All those years ago
When you gave us a miracle
Am I too late for a miracle?

- The tiles were falling,
and there were cracks everywhere.
And the candle almost went out.
(INDISTINCT MURMURING)
Show me.
MIRABEL: What? (GASPS)
No, that's...
The cracks were there.
They were everywhere.
The house was in trouble,
- the candle was...
- (SCOFFS)
Abuela, I promise...
That's enough.
There is nothing wrong
with La Casa Madrigal.
The magic is strong.
- And so are the drinks.

- (INDISTINCT CHATTER)

MIRABEL: If it was all in my head,
how did I cut my hand?
I would never ruin Antonio's night.
Is that really what you think?
What I think is that
today was very hard for you.
That's... (GRUNTS)
I was looking out for the family.
And I might not be
super strong like Luisa,
or effortlessly perfect
like seorita perfecta Isabela
who's never even had
a bad hair day, but...
(SIGHS) Whatever.
I wish you could see yourself
the way I do.
You are perfect just like this.
You're just as special
as anyone else in this family.
Mm-hmm.
You just healed my hand
with an arepa con queso.
I healed your hand
with my love for my daughter
- with her wonderful brain...
- (GROANS)
...and big heart, cool glasses...
Stop!
Mam!
(SPEAKING SPANISH)
(SIGHS)
Mira, my brother Bruno
lost his way in this family.
I don't want the same for you.
Get some sleep.
You'll feel better tomorrow.
(SIGHS)
(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING)
(GRUNTS)
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACH)
(GASPS SOFTLY)
Ay, Pedro.
I need you.
Cracks in our casita.
If our family knew
how vulnerable we truly are...
If our miracle is dying...
We cannot lose our home again.
(SIGHS) Why is this happening?
Open my eyes.
If the answer is here, help me find it.
Help me protect our family.
Help me save our miracle.
I will save the miracle.
(UPLIFTING MUSIC PLAYS)
Wait. How do I save a miracle?
(CREAKS)
I figure out what's happening
to the miracle.
Oh, I have no idea.
But there is one person in this family
who hears everything about everything.
So, if anyone would know
what's wrong with the magic...
- Hey!
- MIRABEL: ...it's her.
Dolores, hey.
You know, out of all my older cousins,
you're, like, my favorite cousin,
so I feel like I can talk
to you about anything,
ergo you can talk to me about anything.
Like the problem with the magic last night
that no one seemed to worry about,
but maybe you heard about that
maybe I should know about.
Camilo! Stop pretending you're Dolores
so you can have seconds.
Worth a shot. Ah!
(GRUNTS)
(GROANS)
The only one worried
about the magic is you
and the rats talking in the walls.
Oh, and Luisa,
I heard her eye twitching
all night. (SQUEAKS)
There we go.
Everyone, to the table!
Let's go, let's go.
- Luisa.
- ABUELA: Family.
We are all thankful
for Antonio's wonderful new (GRUNTS) Gift.
I told them to warm up your seat.
Thank you, Toito.
I'm sure today we'll find a way
to put your blessings to good use.
(SOFTLY) Luisa, Dolores says
you're totally freaking out.
Any chance you maybe know something
about last night with the magic...
- (GASPS) You do!
- ABUELA: Mirabel!
If you can't pay attention,
I will help you.
- Oh, actually...
- Casita!
(GRUNTING)
As I was saying,
we must never take our miracle
for granted,
so today we will work twice as hard.
- Mm-hmm. I will help Luisa.
- Stop.
(GRUNTING)
First, an announcement.
I've spoken to the Guzmns
about Mariano's proposal to Isabela.
Dolores, do we have a date?
Tonight. He wants five babies.
- (ISABELA GULPS)
- Wonderful!
Such a fine young man
with our perfect Isabela
will bring a new generation
of magical blessings
and make both of our families stronger.
(MAKES KISSING SOUNDS)
Okay. Our community is counting on us.
La Familia Madrigal!
ALL: La Familia Madrigal!
La Familia Madrigal!
Luisa, hey. What?
- (GRUNTS) Sorry.
- What is your problem?
MIRABEL: Hey! Luisa, hold up!
- (LUISA GRUNTS)
- (BELLS RINGING)
SEORA OZMA: Luisa, can you
- re-route the river?
- Will do.
Luisa, the donkeys got out again.
LUISA: On it.
(GRUNTS)
Luisa! (YELPS)
Wait a second! (GROANS)
You gotta tell me about the magic.
What's going on? What are you hiding?
Nothing. Just got a lot of chores,
so maybe you should just go home.
Luisa, my house is leaning to the...
Dolores said your eye was twitching,
and it never twitches.
Something's making you nervous.
Hey, move. You're gonna
make me drop a donkey.
Luisa, will you just... (SCOFFS)
- Just tell me what it is.
- There's nothing to tell.
You're obviously worried about something.
Luisa, if you know
what's hurting the magic
and it gets worse,
'cause you won't tell me
- what's wrong...
- (LOUDLY) Nothing's wrong!
Wow, uh, sorry.
That... That snuck out there.
What I meant was, um...
Why would anything be wrong?
I'm totally fine. The magic's fine.
Luisa's fine. I'm totally not nervous.
Your eye is doing the thing...
I'm the strong one
I'm not nervous
I'm as tough as the crust
Of the Earth is
Okay.
LUISA:
I move mountains
I move churches
And I glow 'cause I know
What my worth is
Of course, I mean...
Hey, where are you going?
I don't ask How hard the work is
Got a rough
Indestructible surface
Diamonds and platinum
I find 'em I flatten 'em
I take what I'm handed
I break what's demanded
But under the surface
I feel berserk
As a tightrope walker
In a three-ring circus
Under the surface
Was Hercules ever like
"Yo, I don't wanna fight Cerberus"
- (SCREAMS, WHIMPERS)
- Under the surface
I'm pretty sure I'm worthless
If I can't be of service
A flaw or a crack
The straw in the stack
That breaks the camel's back
What breaks the camel's back?
It's pressure
Like a drip, drip, drip
That'll never stop
Whoa
Pressure that'll tip, tip, tip
Till you just go pop
Whoa
Give it to your sister
Your sister's older
Give her all the heavy things
We can't shoulder
Who am I
If I can't run with the ball?
If I fall to pressure
Like a grip, grip, grip
And it won't let go
Whoa
Pressure like A tick, tick, tick
Till it's ready to blow
Whoa
Give it to your sister
Your sister's stronger
See if she can hang on
A little longer
Who am I
If I can't carry it all?
If I falter
Under the surface
I hide my nerves And it worsens
I worry
Something is gonna hurt us
Under the surface
The ship doesn't swerve
As it heard
How big the iceberg is
Under the surface
I think about my purpose
Can I somehow preserve this?
Line up the dominos
A light wind blows
You try to stop it topplin'
But on and on it goes But wait
If I could shake
The crushing weight
Of expectations
Would that free
Some room up for joy
Or relaxation?
Or a simple pleasure
Instead we measure
This growing pressure
Keeps growing
Keep going 'Cause all we know is
Pressure like A drip, drip, drip
That'll never stop
Whoa
Pressure that'll tip, tip, tip
Till you just go pop
Whoa
Give it to your sister
It doesn't hurt
And see if she can handle
Every family burden
Watch as she buckles
And bends but never breaks
No mistakes
Just pressure
Like a grip, grip, grip
And it won't let go
Whoa
Pressure like A tick, tick, tick
Till it's ready to blow
Whoa
Give it to your sister
And never wonder
If the same pressure
Would have pulled you under
Who am I
If I don't have what it takes?
No cracks No breaks
No mistakes No pressure
(PANTING)
(SIGHS)
I think you're carrying
way too much... (GRUNTS)
Maybe I overdo it.
Yep.
Um... There is something you should know.
Last night, when you saw the cracks,
I felt weak.
(HESITATING) What?
- MAN: Luisa! The donkeys!
- On it!
Wait, wait, wait. What do you mean?
What do you think's hurting the magic?
Don't know, but I heard
the grown-ups once.
Before To Bruno left,
he had, like,
some terrible vision about it.
To Bruno? What was in his vision?
No one knows. They never found it.
But if something's wrong with the magic,
start with Bruno's tower.
Find that vision.
Wait! How do you find a vision?
- What am I even looking for?
- (DONKEY BRAYS)
If you find it, you'll know.
But be careful.
That place is off limits for a reason.
ABUELA: Such a perfect match.
So perfect.
And so good for the encanto.
(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING)
(GRUNTING)
Hmm.
Casita.
Can you turn off the sand?
(FLOOR TILES RUMBLING)
You can't help in here?
I'll be fine.
I need to do this.
For you, for Abuela,
maybe a little for me.
(EXHALES)
"Find the vision, save the..."
(SCREAMS)
(GROANS)
(SPITS)
Wow.
- Oh, hello.
- (SQUAWKS)
Lot of stairs,
but at least I'll have a friend.
No. He flew away immediately.

All right.
(SINGING) Welcome to the family Madrigal
There's so many stairs
In the casa Madrigal
You think there would be
Another way to
Get so high
'Cause we're magic, but no
Magical how many stairs fit in here!
Bruno, your room is the worst!

Where are you coming from in such a hurry?
I'm sorry, I was...
- What is in your hair?
- (HESITATING)
LUISA: My Gift!
- (SOBBING) I'm losing my Gift!
- What?
Mirabel and I were having this little talk
about me carrying too much.
So, I tried not to carry so much,
but I realized it was putting me behind.
And I knew I was gonna let everyone down.
And I felt really bad,
so I was grabbing all the donkeys,
but then when I went to throw
the donkeys in the barn, they were
heavy! (SOBBING)
(DOOR SLAMS SHUT)
What did you do? What did you say to her?
Nothing. I... I don't...
- Mirabel... (SIGHS)
- (CHURCH BELLS RINGING)
I have to go get the Guzmns
for Isabela's engagement.
Stay away from Luisa
until I can talk to her.
Tonight, we can't have any more problems.
And whatever you're doing, stop doing it.
- (LUISA SOBBING)
- (CREAKING)
(EXHALES)
Why am I in your vision, Bruno?
- (THUNDER RUMBLES)
- (GASPS)
Ta! Jeez.
Sorry. Sorry, I didn't mean to...
Shoo, shoo, shoo!
(GRUNTS)
I just wanted to get
the last of Toito's things
and then I heard the name we do not speak.
Great. Now I'm thundering,
and that thunder will lead to a drizzle
and a drizzle will lead to a sprinkle...
Clear skies, clear skies.
(EXHALES) Clear skies.
Ta Pepa? If... (HESITATING)
If he had a vision about someone,
what would it mean for them?
We don't talk about Bruno.
I know. It's just hypothetically,
if he saw you...
Mirabel, please, we need to
get ready for the Guzmns.
I just wanna know if it was generally
positive or, like, less positive...
- It was a nightmare!
- Flix!
Hey, she needs to know, Pepi,
she needs to know.
We don't talk about Bruno.
He would see something terrible.
And then...
(MAKES TICKING SOUND)
Boom! It would happen.
We don't talk about Bruno.
What if you didn't understand what he saw?
Then you better figure it out,
because it was coming for you.
We don't talk
About Bruno-no-no-no
We don't talk about Bruno
-But it was my wedding day
-It was our wedding day
We were getting ready
And there wasn't a cloud
In the sky
No clouds allowed in the sky
Bruno walks in
With a mischievous grin
Thunder
You're telling the story
Or am I?
I'm sorry, mi vida Go on
Bruno says it looks like rain
Why did he tell her?
In doing so He floods my brain
Abuela gets the umbrella
PEPA:
Married in a hurricane
(CROWD CLAMORING)
What a joyous day But anyway
We don't talk about
Bruno-no-no-no
We don't talk about Bruno
Hey
Grew to live in fear of
Bruno stuttering or stumbling
I can always hear him
Sort of muttering
And mumbling
I associate him with
The sound of falling sand
(SHUSHING)
It's a heavy lift
With a Gift so humbling
Always left Abuela and the family fumbling
Grappling with prophecies
They couldn't understand
Do you understand?
Seven-foot frame
Rats along his back
When he calls your name
It all fades to black
Yeah, he sees your dreams
And feasts on your screams
We don't talk about
Bruno-no-no-no
We don't talk about Bruno
He told me my fish would die
The next day dead
CHORUS: No, no
He told me I'd grow a gut
And just like he said
-No, no
-He said that all my hair
Would disappear
Now look at my head
CHORUS: No, no
Your fate is sealed
When your prophecy is read
He told me
That the life of my dreams
Would be promised
And someday be mine
(MIRABEL SCOFFS)
He told me
That my power would grow
Like the grapes
That thrive on the vine
ABUELA:
Oye Mariano's on his way
He told me
That the man of my dreams
Would be just out of reach
Betrothed to another
-It's like I hear him now
-Hey, sis
I want not a sound out of you
DOLORES:
I can hear him now
Um, Bruno Yeah, about that Bruno
I really need to know
About Bruno
Give me the truth
And the whole truth, Bruno
Isabela Your boyfriend's here!
ALL: Time for dinner
-It was my wedding day
-It was our wedding day

Why did I talk about Bruno?
ALL:
Not a word about Bruno
I never should have
Brought up Bruno
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
Miraboo! Got your party pants on?
'Cause I...
(GRUNTS, CHUCKLES)
I broke into Bruno's tower.
I found his last vision.
The family's in trouble.
The magic is dying. The house is breaking,
Luisa's gift is fading.
And I think it's all because of me?
P?
(DOORBELL RINGS)
We say nothing.
Abuela wants tonight to be perfect.
Until the Guzmns leave,
you did not break into Bruno's tower.
The magic is not dying.
The house is not breaking.
Luisa's gift is not fading.
(SOFTLY) No one will know.
Just act normal.
- No one has to know.
- (DOLORES SQUEAKS)
(WHISPERS) I know. (SQUEAKS)
She's gonna tell everyone.
- ABUELA: Time to eat!
- Miercoles.
The Guzmns and the Madrigals together
will be so good for the encanto.
Yes. Then, let's hope tonight
is not a horrible disaster.

Everything okay?
(CHUCKLES) Everything is great.
She's just excited.
For you to propose.
Which, uh, you should do!
- Yes.
- As fast as you can.
Uh, I was actually gonna...
You were actually gonna. Great!
(HESITATING) Well, since
everyone here has a talent,
my Mariano wanted to begin with a song!
Luisa, could you bring over the piano?
- (VOICE BREAKING) Okay.
- (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)
Uh, it's actually family tradition
to sing after.
(MARIANO CLEARS THROAT)
Isabela, most graceful

It's Bruno's vision! It's...

Why did you take the vision?
Knock, knock, knock,
knock, knock. Knock on wood.
- MIRABEL: What does it mean?
- (INHALES SHARPLY)
Is it why you came back or...
- (EXHALES DEEPLY)
- To Bruno?
Knock, knock, knock, knock,
knock. Knock on wood.
You were never supposed to see
that vision. No one was.
- But... (SPITS)
- A little salt.
- Sugar.
- (SPITS)
(BRUNO SPEAKING SPANISH)
Have you been in here patching the cracks?
Oh, that? No, no, no.
I'm too scared to go near those things.
All the patching's done by Hernando.
Who is Hernando?
(IN DEEP VOICE) I'm Hernando
and I'm scared of nothing!
(IN NORMAL VOICE)
It's actually me. (CHUCKLES)
I used to say my real Gift
was "acting." (CHUCKLES)
(IN ALTERED VOICE) I'm Jorge.
I make the spackle.
How long have you been back here?
(SQUEAKING)
You never left.
Well, I left my tower,
which was, you know, a lot of stairs
and here, eh, kitchen adjacent.
(CLICKS TONGUE)
Ooh, ooh, plus, free entertainment.
So, what do you like? You like sports?
Game shows? Telenovelas?
(RATS SQUEALING)
Their love could never be.
I don't understand.
Well, because she's his aunt
and she has amnesia
so she can't remember that she's his aunt.
It's like a very forbidden kind of...
I don't understand why you left,
but didn't leave.
Oh, well, because, huh,
the mountains around
the encanto are pretty tall.
And, uh, like I said,
free food and everything.
You guys love the free food, don't ya?
Always hungry. Never satisfied.
(MELANCHOLY MUSIC PLAYING)
Yeah, my Gift wasn't helping the family,
but, uh, I love my family, you know?
I just don't know how to...
I just don't know how to...
Well, anyway, I think
you should go, because, um,
I don't really have a good reason,
but, if I did, you'd be like,
"I should go,
because that's a good reason."
Why was I in your vision?
To Bruno?
I just wanted to make
the family proud of me.
Just once.
But if I should stop,
if I'm hurting my family,
just tell me.
- I can't tell you...
- (MIRABEL SIGHS)
...because I don't know.
I had this vision the night
that you didn't get your Gift.
Abuela worried about the magic.
So, she begged me to look into the future.
See what it meant.
And I saw the magic in danger.
Our house breaking.
And then, and then, and then, I saw you.
But the vision was different.
It... it would change.
And there was no one answer.
No clear fate.
Like your future was undecided.
But I knew how it was gonna look.
I knew what everyone would think
because I'm Bruno
and everyone always assumes
the worst, so...
(SIGHS) so...
You left to protect me?
I don't know which way it'll go,
but my guess...
the family, the encanto
and the fate of the miracle itself...
Well, it's all gonna come down to you.
Or maybe I'm wrong.
You know, it's a mystery.
That's why this vision is...
(BLOWS RASPBERRY)
Look, if I could help any more, I would,
but that's all I know.
Good luck. I wish I could've seen more.
Yeah.
Yeah.
(YELPS)
You wish you could have
seen more, so see more!
Have another vision.
Oh. No, no. See,
I don't do visions anymore.
- But you could.
- But I won't.
You can't say the weight of the world
is on your shoulders. The end.
If our fate's up to me,
me says have another vision.
Maybe it'll show me what to do.
Look, even if I wanted to, which I don't,
you wrecked my vision cave.
Which is a problem,
'cause I need a big open space.
- We'll find one.
- Where?
ANTONIO: Use my room.
The rats told me everything.
Don't eat those.
Our family needs help,
and you need to get outta here.
(RATS SQUEAKING)
Meh.
(RUMBLING)
(KIDS GASP, PANT)
You should have told me
the second you saw the vision.
Think of the family.
I was thinking of my daughter.
Pepa, calm down.
- I'm doing my best.
- Yes.
You're lucky it's not a hurricane.
Mam, you've always been
too hard on Mirabel.
Look around.
We must protect our family, our e ncanto.
- We cannot lose our home.
- (DOOR OPENS)
Seora, perdon.
People in town are becoming anxious
about the magic.
They want to see you.
(SIGHS) Mirabel was
in that vision for a reason.
Find her.
- (RUMBLING)
- (BIRDS SQUAWKING)
We might wanna hurry.
You can't hurry the future.
Um... (CHUCKLES)
What if I show you something worse?
If I see something
that you don't like, you're gonna be all,
"Bruno makes bad things happen.
"Oh, he's creepy
and his vision killed my goldfish."
I don't think you make bad things happen.
Sometimes family weirdos
just get a bad rap.
You can do this.
For the nerves.
(GROWLS SOFTLY)
I can do this. I can do this,
I can do this, I can do this.

BRUNO: It's just the same thing.
I gotta stop!
No. I need to know which way it goes.
There's gotta be an answer.
Something we're not seeing!
You're looking at
the same thing that I am.
If there was something else...
There! Over there!
BRUNO: Butterfly!
Follow the butterfly!
Where is that?
BRUNO: (HESITATING) It's all out of order.
It's the candle.
The candle's getting brighter!
I think you're gonna help the candle!
How?
Uh, there's someone with you. And you...
- You fight her!
- What?
Wait, no, no. Is that a hug?
Am I fighting or hugging?
An embrace. An embrace!
To make the candle bright
you have to embrace her.
Embrace who?
BRUNO: Oh... Almost there.
- Who is it?
- Almost there. Oh, oh.
I got it!
(INCREDULOUSLY) Isabela?
Oh, your sister? That's great!
(GROWLS)
(SIGHS) Every time.
(VISION SHATTERS)
MIRABEL: (SCOFFS) Why would
embracing Isabela do anything?
I don't know. Our family got a miracle.
How do you help a family miracle?
You hug a sister.
Mirabel? (SIGHS) Mirabel? (BURBLING)
(IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE) Mirabel?
Well, I think we're running
out of time here.
It's not gonna work.
She won't hug me ever, okay? She hates me!
Also, I don't know if you heard,
I ruined her proposal!
Plus, P.S...
- (WHISPERS) Mirabel?
- ...she is just annoying.
- Of course it's Isabela!
- Mirabel?
What's her problem with me anyway?
She's the one with roses
coming out of her...
(LOUDLY) Mirabel!
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
You see, you're missing the point.
The fate of the family,
it's not up to her.
It's up to you.
You're exactly what this family needs.
You just have to see it.
By yourself, after I leave.
(GRUNTS)
What, you're not coming?
(IN DEEP VOICE) It was
your vision, Mirabel.
Not mine.
You're afraid Abuela will see you.
(IN NORMAL VOICE) Yep.
I mean, yes, that too.
Hey, after you save the miracle,
come visit.
After I save the miracle,
I'm bringing you home.
Knock, knock, knock, knock,
knock. Knock on wood.
(INHALES SHARPLY)
(CASITA CREAKING)
(EXHALES) You got this.
Just gonna save the miracle.
With a hug.
Isa? Hey.
I know we've had our issues,
but I'm (HESITATES)
ready to be a better sister... to you.
So, we should just hug.
Let's hug it out, huh?
ISABELA: "Hug it out"?
Luisa can't lift an empanada,
Mariano's nose
looks like a smashed papaya!
Have you lost your mind?
(SMACKS LIPS)
Isa, I feel like you're upset.
And you know what cures being upset?
A warm embrace.
Get out.
- (HESITATING)
- Everything was perfect.
Abuela was happy. The family was happy.
You wanna be a better sister?
Apologize for ruining my life.
Go on. Apologize.
I...
am...
sorry...
Hmm.
...that your life is so great!
Out.
Wait!
(GRUNTS) Fine! I apologize!
I wasn't trying to ruin your life!
(GRUNTS)
Some of us have bigger problems,
- you selfish...
- (GASPS)
...entitled princess!
"Selfish"?
I've been stuck being perfect
my whole entire life!
And literally, the only thing
you have ever done for me
is mess things up!
Nothing is messed up!
You can still marry that big dumb hunk!
I never wanted to marry him!
I was doing it for the family!
Oh, my gosh.
Isa,
that is a very serious confession.
(SIGHS) Okay, get over here.
Bring it in.
Isa?
(SIGHS)
I just made s omething unexpected
Something sharp Something new
Isa? Uh, this is the part where we...
It's not symmetrical Or perfect
But it's beautiful
And it's mine
What else can I do?
Wait Bring it in, bring it in
Good talk
Bring it in, bring it in
What else can I do?
Let's hug
Bring it in, bring it in
Free hugs
Bring it in, bring it in
I grow rows and rows of roses
Flor de mayo by the mile
I make perfect Practiced poses
So much hides behind my smile
What could I do if I just grew
What I was feeling
In the moment?
Do you know Where you're going?
What could I do if I just knew
It didn't need to be perfect?
It just needed to be
And they let me be
A hurricane of jacarands
-Strangling figs
-Fig!
Hanging vines
This is fine
Palma de cera fills the air
As I climb and I push through
What else can I do?
Can I deliver us
A river of sundew?
Careful, it's carnivorous
A little just won't do
I wanna feel the shiver
Of something new
I'm so sick of pretty
I want something true Don't you?
You just seemed
Like your life's been a dream
Since the moment
You opened your eyes
How far do these roots Go down?
All I know
Are the blossoms you grow
But it's awesome to see how
You rise
- How far can I rise?
- How far can you rise?
Through the roof to the skies
Let's go
A hurricane of jacarands
-Strangling figs
-Go
-Hanging vines
-Grow
Palma de cera fills the air
As I climb and I push through
What else?
What else?
What can you do when you are
Deeply madly truly
In the moment?
Seize the moment Keep going
What can you do when you know
Who you want to be
Isn't perfect?
-But I'll still be okay
-Hey, everybody clear the way
I'm coming through With tabebuia
Tabebuia
-Making waves
-Making waves
-Changing minds
-You've changed mine
The way is clearer
'Cause you're here
And well I owe this all to you
What else can I do?
MIRABEL: Show them what you can do
- What else can I do?
- There's nothing you can't do
ISABELA: What else can I do?
- You're a bad influence.
- (BOTH LAUGH)
ABUELA: (ANGRILY) What is going on?
- (GASPS)
- Abuela?
It's okay! Everything's...
We're gonna save the miracle. The magic...
What are you talking about?
Look at our home! Look at your sister!
Please just... Isabela wasn't happy.
Of course she isn't happy.
You ruined her proposal.
No, no, no. She needed me
to ruin her proposal.
- And then we did all this!
- (ABUELA GRUNTS)
And the candle burned brighter
and the cracks...
- Mirabel.
- That's why I'm in the vision!
I'm saving the miracle!
You have to stop, Mirabel!
The cracks started with you.
- Bruno left because of you.
- (CRACKING)
Luisa's losing her powers.
Isabela's out of control.
Because of you!
I don't know why you weren't given a Gift,
but it is not an excuse
for you to hurt this family.
- (BREATHING HEAVILY)
- (CRACKING GROWS LOUDER)
(SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING)
I will never be good enough for you.
Will I?
No matter how hard I try.
No matter how hard any of us tries.
Luisa will never be strong enough.
Isabela won't be perfect enough.
Bruno left our family because
you only saw the worst in him.
Bruno didn't care about this family.
He loves this family.
I love this family.
We all love this family.
You're the one that doesn't care.
(PEOPLE EXCLAIMING)
You're the one breaking our home.
Don't you ever...
The miracle is dying, because of you.

MAN: (SINGING IN SPANISH)
Two caterpillars
(IMPERCEPTIBLE)
In love
Spend their nights and dawns
Full of hunger
They keep walking
And navigating the world
That changes and keeps changing
Navigating a world
That changes and keeps changing
Two caterpillars stop the wind
As they hold each other
with warmth and consent
Keep growing
They don't know when
To find some corner shelter
The time keeps changing
They are inseparable
And the weather keeps changing
(IMPERCEPTIBLE)
Oh, caterpillars
Don't hold each other any longer
You must grow apart and return
That's the way forward
Miracles are coming
Chrysalises are coming
You must part
And construct your own future
Oh, caterpillars
Don't hold each other any longer
You must grow apart and return
That's the way forward
Miracles are coming
Chrysalises are coming
You must part
And construct your own future
Two caterpillars
Disoriented
In two cocoons
All bundled up
ABUELA: I was given a miracle.
A second chance.
And I was so afraid to lose it
that I lost sight
of who our miracle was for.
And I am so sorry.
You never hurt our family, Mirabel.
We are broken...
because of me.
(MUSIC ENDS)
(HOPEFUL MUSIC PLAYING)
MIRABEL: Abuela.
I can finally see.
You lost your home.
Lost everything.
You suffered so much,
all alone,
so it would never happen again.
We were saved because of you.
We were given a miracle, because of you.
We are a family, because of you.
And nothing could ever be broken
that we can't fix... together.
I asked my Pedro for help.
Mirabel.
He sent me you.
(DOS ORUGUITAS PLAYING)
MAN: (SINGING IN SPANISH)
Oh, butterflies
Don't hold each other any longer
You must grow apart and return
That's the way forward
You are already miracles
Breaking chrysalises
You must fly
And find your own future
BRUNO: She didn't do this! Whoa!
She didn't do this!
I gave her a vision!
(GRUNTS) It was me!
I was, like, "Go!" And she was, like...
(BLOWS RASPBERRY) She only wanted to help.
I don't care
what you think of me, but if you're
- too stubborn to...
- (GASPS SOFTLY)
Brunito.
I feel like I missed something important.
Come on.
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)
What... What's happening?
Where are we going?
- (EXHALES) Home.
- (GRUNTS)
It's her! I found her!
I found her!
She's back! She's back, she's back!
JULIETA: Mirabel!
Mirabel!
Mam.
Mi amor, I was so worried.
We couldn't find you.
There were bees everywhere.
I'll be okay.
Uh... Not if we don't have a house.
What? We don't have a house.
I can't say we don't have a house?
What is that? Not a house.
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)
Look at this home
We need a new foundation
It may seem hopeless
But we'll get by just fine
Look at this family
A glowing constellation
So full of stars
And everybody wants to shine
But the stars don't shine
They burn
And the constellations shift
I think it's time you learn
You're more Than just your Gift
And I'm sorry
I held on too tight
Just so afraid I'd lose you too
The miracle is not
Some magic that you've got
- (GASPS)
- The miracle is you
Not some Gift Just you
The miracle is you
All of you All of you
Okay so
We gonna talk about Bruno?
That's Bruno?
Yeah There's a lot to say
About Bruno
I'll start, okay
Pepa, I'm sorry
About your wedding
Didn't mean to be upsetting
That wasn't a prophecy
I could just see
You were sweating
And I wanted you to know
That your bro loves you so
Let it in, let it out
Let it rain, let it snow
Let it go
That's what I'm always saying, bro
I got a lot of apologies I got to say
Hey, we're just happy
that you're here, okay?
-Come into the light
-That trip was only a night
And no matter what happens
We're gonna find our way
Yo, I knew he never left
I heard him every day
(CHORUS VOCALIZING)
(CREAKING)
What's that sound?
I think it's everyone in town
ALL: Hey
Lay down your load
Lay down your load
Roll me down the road
Roll me down the road
We have no Gifts But we are many
And we'll do anything for you
It's a dream
When we work as a team
You're so strong
-Yeah, but sometimes I cry
-BOTH: So do I
I may not be as strong
But I'm getting wiser
Yeah, I need sunlight
And fertilizer
Come on
Let's plant something new
And watch it fly
Straight up to the sky
Let's go
The stars don't shine They burn
The constellations glow
The seasons change in turn
Would you watch
Our little girl go
She takes after you
(SIGHS)
Hey, Mariano Why so blue?
I just have So much love inside
You know
I've got this cousin too
Have you met Dolores?
Okay, I'll take it from here. Goodbye!
You talk so loud
You take care of your mother
And you make her proud
You write your own poetry
Every night When you go to sleep
And I'm seizing the moment
So would you wake up
And notice me
Dolores, I see you.
- And I hear you.
- BOTH: Yes!
CHORUS: All of you
All of you
- Let's get married.
- Slow down.
CHORUS: All of you
All of you
Home sweet home
I like the new foundation
It isn't perfect
-Neither are we
-That's true
Just one more thing
Before the celebration
- What?
- We need a doorknob
We made this one for you.
ALL: We see
How bright you burn
We see how brave you've been
Now see yourself in turn
You're the real Gift, kid
Let us in
Open your eyes
(REPEATS IN SPANISH)
I see... me.
All of me

(MUSIC ENDS)
(TWO ORUGUITAS PLAYING)
Two oruguitas
In love and yearning
Spend every evening
And morning learning
To hold each other
Their hunger burning
To navigate a world
That's changing
Never stops turning
Together in this world
That's changing
Never stops turning
Two oruguitas
Against the weather
The wind grows colder
As they're together
They hold each other
No way of knowing
They're all they have for shelter
And something inside them is growing
They'll all just stay together
But something inside them is growing
Aye, oruguitas
Don't you hold on too tight
Both of you know
It's your time to grow
To fall apart To reunite
Wonders await you
Just on the other side
Trust they'll be there
Start to prepare
Don't wait for tomorrow
Aye, oruguitas
Don't you hold on too tight
Both of you know
It's your time to grow
To fall apart To reunite
Wonders await you
Just on the other side
Trust they'll be there
Start to prepare
Don't wait for tomorrow
(CHORUS VOCALIZING)
Two oruguitas
Cocooned and waiting
Each in their own world
Anticipating
What happens after
The rearranging
And so afraid of change
In a world that never stops changing
So let the walls come down
The world will never stop changing
-Never stop changing
-Never stop changing
Never stop changing
Aye, mariposa
Don't you hold on too tight
Both of you know
It's your time to go
To fly apart To reunite
Wonders surround you
Just let the walls come down
Don't look behind you
Fly till you find
Your way till tomorrow
Aye, mariposa
Don't you hold on too tight
Both of you know
It's your time to grow
To fly apart To reunite
Wonders surround you
Just let the walls come down
Don't look behind you
Fly till you find
Your way till tomorrow
Aye, mariposa
Don't you hold on too tight
Both of you know
It's your time to grow
To fly apart To reunite
Wonders surround you
Just let the walls come down
Don't look behind you
Fly till you find
Your way till tomorrow
